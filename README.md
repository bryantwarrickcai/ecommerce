**Explain the use of git in software development!**

Answer: Git is a version control system that can be used to track changes in code and files over time. Git is very heavily used in software development, as it stores a complete history of all the changes in the project, allowing developers to review and revert the codebase. Git allows collaboration on projects, and provides detailed logs for who made the specific changes, when, and why.

Git also enables developers to create branches, for separate lines of development. This allows testing and working on new features and bug fixes without affecting the main codebase. Once work on a branch is complete, the code can be merged back into the main branch. Code in Git can be stored in a remote repository (such as GitHub), where other collaborators can pull these changes to their local devices.

**In your opinion, out of all the frameworks available, why is Django used as the starting point for learning software development?**

Answer: Django provides a comprehensive framework that simplifies many aspects of building web applications. Django already provides everything needed to build a web application out of the box, such as database management, user authentication, form handling, and URL routing. By learning Django, beginners can learn about both the frontend and backend aspects of web development. Django is also built in Python, which is usually considered a great programming language for beginners.

**Why is the Django model called an ORM?**

Answer: ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapper. A Django model is called an ORM because it provides a way to interact with relational databases using object-oriented programming. ORM allows mapping Python objects (like Django models) to database tables.
